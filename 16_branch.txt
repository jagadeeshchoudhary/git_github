# Branching and Merging in Git:
# Git branching allows you to isolate work in separate environments, 
# making it easier to develop features, fix bugs, and experiment 
# without affecting the main project.


# create new branch
git branch <branch-name>

# switch between branches
git switch <branch-name>

# create a new branch and switch to the branch.
git switch -c <branch-name>

# drop -c to switch to existing branch
git switch <branch-name>

# git checkout -b branch_name (old way)


# Renaming a branch
git branch -m <old-name> <new-name>


# deleting a branch
git branch --delete <branch-name>
git branch -d <branch-name>
git branch -D <branch-name>  (Forcefully delete a branch even if unmerged)



# merge
# merge <branch> to current branch
git merge <branch-name>

# show branches which are merged
git branch --merged

# show which are not merged
git branch --no-merged

# abort merge
git merge --abort


# List all of the branches in your repo.
git branch
git branch -l
