# Revert a commit: The git revert command creates a new commit that undoes 
# the changes made by a specified commit. 
# Unlike git reset, it does not alter commit history, 
# making it safe for shared repositories.

# Create new commit that undoes all of the changes made in <commit>, 
# then apply it to the current commit.
git revert <commit-sha>

# <commit-sha>: The hash of the commit you want to revert.
# Creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the specified commit.
# Applies the revert to the current branch.
