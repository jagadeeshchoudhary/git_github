The git restore command allows you to discard changes in your working directory 
or staging area, reverting files to their last committed state.

# Restoring Files in the Working Directory
# Reverts the specified file to its last committed state.
git restore file_name
git restore .


# Restoring Files in the Staging Area
# Removes specified file from staging area without discarding changes in working directory.
git restore --staged file_name
git restore --staged .


# Restoring Files to a Specific Commit
# Restore a file to the state it was in at a specific commit
git restore filename --source=<sha>


# git restore vs git reset:
# While git restore is used for discarding changes in the working directory or staging area,
# git reset modifies branch history and HEAD.

# Precaution: Always double-check the changes before using git restore as it cannot be undone.
