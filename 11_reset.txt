# reset: The git reset command is used to undo changes by altering the 
# state of your staging area, working directory, or commit history. 
# Its scope depends on the options used (--soft, --mixed, or --hard).

# Remove <file> from the staging area, but leave the working directory unchanged.

# Unstage a specific file without changing its content
git reset <file>


# Reset to a specific commit
# git reset is useful when we want to undo commits that have not been pushed to a remote repository.
# Moves the HEAD pointer to the specified commit.
# By default, it leaves changes in the working directory (equivalent to --mixed)
git reset <commit-sha>
* don't use
git reset --soft commit-sha   (same as above)

# Moves the HEAD to the specified commit.
# Discards all changes in the staging area and working directory.
# Warning: This is irreversible and should be used with extreme caution.
git reset --hard commit-sha
** very danger
